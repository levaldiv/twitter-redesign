# Twitter Blockchain Web 3.0 Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a Twitter Blockchain Web 3.0 Challenge! We were tasked to create a semi-replicate
the Twitter app with its NFT properties (you can have a verified NFT as your profile picture). This was definitely another challeging YET exciting build as it focused on what most Big Companies use today.

**NOTE:** This is all created using Solidity and the Rinkeby Test Network. THIS IS NOT REAL ETHEREUM.

## How to use

- Connect with Metamask
- Click 'Sign in'
- It will connect your current Wallet from Metamask or you can create a new account
- It will log you in to the Home page where you can see tweets from anyone
- You can also create your own tweets
- Click on 'mint' and you will be able to mint your own image and set is as your profile picture
- You can also click on PROFILE on the left and it will take you to YOUR profile where you can see
  everything that YOU posted
