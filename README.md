# Twitter Blockchain Web 3.0 Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a Twitter Blockchain Web 3.0 Challenge! We were tasked to create a semi-replicate
the Twitter app with its NFT properties (you can have a verified NFT as your profile picture). This was definitely another challeging YET exciting build as it focused on what most Big Companies use today.

**NOTE:** This is all created using Solidity and the Rinkeby Test Network. THIS IS NOT REAL ETHEREUM.
